# RandomForest_with_RandomizedSearchCV

## On the Titanic Data Set, tried to predict the values using the Rondom Forest Algorithm. And I observed the model overfitted. So tried to do the Hyperparameter Tuning with the help of Randomized Search CV and observed the difference.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Random Forest Algorithm

**Advantages**

It can be used for both regression and classification tasks.

It is easy to view the relative importance classifier assigns to the input features.

They handle the missing values on its own and understanding hyperparameter setting is easy.

They helps to prevent overfitting of the data over the model.


**Disadvantages**

A large number of trees can make the algorithm slow and ineffective for real-time predictions.

The alogrithm produces a predictive model and not a descriptive one i.e. explaining the model is difficult.

A black box approach for statistical modelers i.e. you have a very little control on what the model does.
